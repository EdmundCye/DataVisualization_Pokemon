## Local Web Server Setup with XAMPP
This guide will walk you through setting up a local web server using XAMPP, opening an HTML file in a code editor, and viewing it in a web browser. This is a common setup for web development and testing.
### 1. Install and Start XAMPP
- Download the XAMPP installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the official XAMPP website.
- Follow the installation instructions provided on the website for your specific operating system.
- Start the Apache server using the XAMPP Control Panel.
### 2. Create a Folder for Your Web Project
- Download the folder on your computer to store your web project files. You can place it in the XAMPP "htdocs" directory. For example, on Windows, the default location might be C:\xampp\htdocs.
### 3. Create an HTML File
- Using your code editor, create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) inside the folder you created in the previous step.
- Write your HTML code or edit the existing code into this file.
### 4. Access Your HTML File
- Open your code editor and open the index.html file you created in step 3.
- Feel free to make any changes to the HTML file, and save your changes.
### 5. Access the HTML File via localhost
- Open your web browser.
- In the address bar, type http://localhost/DataVizA2/index.html.
- Press Enter to load your HTML file.
- You should now see your HTML page displayed in the browser.
### 6. Play Around and Test
- You can interact with your HTML page in the browser, and any changes you make to the HTML file in your code editor will be reflected when you refresh the browser page.
